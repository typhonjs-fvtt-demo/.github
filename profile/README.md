## Welcome to TyphonJS-FVTT-Demo

We provide next-gen tooling for the [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) developer community and release a collection of modules aimed at making open world style campaign 
management easier in Foundry. Please come join us on Discord on the [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/737953117999726592?label=TyphonJS&style=plastic)](https://discord.gg/mnbgN8f) 
server to chat about Foundry VTT development and our open world modules. Be sure to signup for various roles for topics you are interested in such as: `Developer` & `Quest Giver` 
to keep updated on topics that interest you.

This organization hosts all of our developer demos and template repos (see READMEs for installation instructions):
- [essential-svelte-esm](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-demo/essential-svelte-esm) (ESM essential demos / Foundry integration)
- [template-svelte-esm](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-demo/template-svelte-esm) (bare bones ESM template repo to create a new module).

Experimental / exploratory:
- [trl-demo-webcomponent](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-demo/trl-demo-webcomponent) (reactive web components!)

The [TyphonJS Runtime Library](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-lib/typhonjs) is the main developer resource available. It provides an augmented [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) 
runtime optimized for Foundry VTT with great integration into the standard Application lifecycle that all 3rd party developers are already familiar with using along with 
several additional resources to supercharge your development experience. 

Please see the [typhonjs-fvtt-lib](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-lib) organization for all of the developer library resources.
